            Thank you Lord that i passed all my semester1 modules,
            even the devil of them all, Parallel Computing (devil emoji).
            Now the goal for Semester2 is to get distictions in all my modules.
            Software Design Project is all about projects and apparently, it doesn't 
            have an exam, so for it we are aiming 92% even though i'll give my 100%. Advanced Analysis and Algorithms 
            sound too "Advanced" mmmmm! but for it we are aiming 81%. For Computer Graphics and Visualisation, why
            do i feel like i will enjoy it, so let's aim 90% for it. Operating Systems and System Programmimg sounds like stress
            but i am not here to play so we're aiming 81% for it.
